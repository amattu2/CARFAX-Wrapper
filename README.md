This is a CARFAX Vehicle History Reporting, QuickVIN, and Service History Check integration toolkit. It provides the interface to achieve the following results:

- Perform a Search History Check 

As achieved through proprietary APIs and integration procedures. Using this PHP based toolkit is not possible without an existing CARFAX Service Data Transfer Facilitation Agreement, and it relies on API keys that are not publicly subscribable (You need to work with someone in the CARFAX Partner Development department).
